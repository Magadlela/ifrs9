The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and other accounting standard setters set out principles-based standards on how banks should recognise and provide for credit losses for financial statement reporting purposes. In July 2014, the IASB issued International Financial Reporting Standard 9 ‚Äì Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which introduced an **'Exprected Credit Loss' (ECL)** framework for the recognition of impairment. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the ECL framework under IFRS 9 and its impact on the regulatory treatment of accounting provisions in the Basel capital framework.
