There are three components related to the PD Model, which is contained unbias PD, forward-looking PD and lifetime PD. All components can be developed by several methodologies and it will cover in this repository.

## The view of PD Model

Many risk analysts consider Basel 12-month PD model as a starting point for IFRS 9 PD model. But we need to consider factors which are important for building IFRS 9 12-month PD Model.

* Point-in-time (PIT) PD : As per IFRS 9 there should be point-in-time (PIT) PD which means consideration of both current macro-economic factors and risk attributes of borrower. Idea is to incorporate current macro economic conditions while calculating PD. In essence PIT PD moves up as macro-economic conditions deteriorate and moves down as macro-economic conditions improve.
* Best Estimate PD : PD estimates should be unbiased which means exclusion of optimism or conservatism (i.e. downturn) in estimation
* It is required to monitor PDs on a continuous basis and perform recalibration when required. PD monitoring reports are essential.
